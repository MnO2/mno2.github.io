        <p>I’ve been watching videos and books to get myself familiar with eBPF tooling, more toward Linux network stack and VFS. This post serves as a note on what I’ve learned.</p>

<p>Brendan Gregg has listed the command line tools that are useful for analyzing a Linux instance if he has to ssh into the instance. They could be preliminary analysis to quickly get a feel on what’s going on on a specific instance.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>uptime</li>
<li>dmesg -T | tail</li>
<li>vmstat 1</li>
<li>mpstat -P ALL 1</li>
<li>pidstat 1</li>
<li>iostat -xz 1</li>
<li>free -m</li>
<li>sar -n DEV 1</li>
<li>sar -n TCP,ETCP 1</li>
<li>top</li>
</ol>
<p>To dig deeper into the detail, these eBPF-based tooling would be helpful.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>execsnoop</li>
<li>opensnoop</li>
<li>ext4slower</li>
<li>biolatency</li>
<li>biosnoop</li>
<li>cachestat</li>
<li>tcpconnect</li>
<li>tcpaccept</li>
<li>tcpretrans</li>
<li>gethostlatency</li>
<li>runqlat</li>
<li>profile</li>
</ol>
<p>When the information you are trying to get are not there, and <code>strace</code> is not enough. The following tools could be helpful to peek into the critical paths in the kernel modules.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>trace</li>
<li>argdist</li>
</ol>
<p>A nice book to read is a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Performance-Tools-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing-ebook-dp-B081ZDXNL3/dp/B081ZDXNL3">new book</a> authored by Brendan.</p>
<p>While studying for the SRE materials, I also found Cloudflare has many good blog posts that I could learn from.</p>
<p>A blog post on how to optimize for <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/http-2-prioritization-with-nginx/">http2</a> stack gives really good insight on how the Linux network stack works.</p>
<pre><code>net.core.default_qdisc = fq
net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control = bbr
net.ipv4.tcp_notsent_lowat = 16384</code></pre>
<p>Their interview questions also makes you start to question yourself if you really know the modern TCP/IP stack.</p>
<pre><code>Archaeology

    What is the lowest TCP port number?

    The TCP frame has an URG pointer field, when is it used?

    Can the RST packet have a payload?

    When is the &quot;flow&quot; field in IPv6 used?

    What does the IP_FREEBIND socket option do?

Forgotten Quirks

    What does the PSH flag actually do?

    The TCP timestamp is implicated in SYN cookies. How?

    Can a &quot;UDP&quot; packet have a checksum field set to zero?

    How does TCP simultaneous open work? Does it actually work?

Fragmentation and Congestion

    What is a stupid window syndrome?

    What are the CWE and ECE flags in TCP header?

    What is the IP ID field and what does it have to do with DF bit? Why do some packets have a non-zero IP ID and a DF set?

Fresh Ideas

    Can a SYN packet have a payload? (hint: new RFC proposals)

    Can a SYN+ACK packet have a payload?

ICMP Path MTU

    ICMP packet-too-big messages are returned by routers and contain a part of the original packet in the payload. What is the minimal length of this payload that is accepted by Linux?

    When an ICMP packet-too-big message is returned by an intermediate router it will have the source IP of that router. In practice though, we often see a source IP of the ICMP message to be identical to the destination IP of the original packet. Why could that happen?

Linux Configuration

    Linux has a &quot;tcp_no_metrics_save&quot; sysctl setting. What does it save and for how long?

    Linux uses two queues to handle incoming TCP connections: the SYN queue and the accept queue. What is the length of the SYN queue?

    What happens if the SYN queue grows too large and overflows?

Touching the router

    What are BGP bogons, and why are they less of a problem now?

    TCP has an extension which adds MD5 checksums to packets. When is it useful?

And finally:

    What are the differences in checksumming algorithms in IPv4 and IPv6?</code></pre>

        <p>I noticed an introduction on xueqiue about <a href="https://www.cambriafunds.com/gval">GVAL</a> ETF the other day. I got intrigued by its strategy and had a look. Its issued Cambria is run by Meb Faber, who runs the podcast on iTunes and quite well-known among investors. I watched his interview with Ed Thorp before. It is a good one.</p>
<p>Roughly speaking the fund’s strategy is to value the countries or regions by Shiller 10 year CAPE ratio and pick the bottom 25% as the universe, and then select the top 30 stocks by the market cap and filter them further by traditional P/E, P/B, P/FCF, EV/EBITDA etc. The final picks are about 100 stocks and rebalance the portfolio every year. For the detail, you could check the <a href="https://www.cambriafunds.com/Data/Sites/30/media/docs/GVAL_Methodology.pdf">prospectus</a></p>
<p>And the pie chart for the regions and countries like this. <img src="../images/2019-11-19/by_region.png" /> <img src="../images/2019-11-19/by_country.png" /></p>
<p>Since fund’s introduction mentioned Graham and Dodds. I couldn’t help to link that with Graham’s net-net strategy, to use a bag of extremely low value to bet it statistically would “somehow” reverse to the mean. I know Graham in general encourage to hold it for 3 years, if nothing happen then sell it. However, seeing the fund’s underperformance in the last two years, I couldn’t help to list a few of the reasons that may not happen.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Country suffers longer than individual company from the structural reason. You could insert new management or somehow an earning quarter activate the hidden value. But country’s policy move slower. New bill need to be passed, and cabinet need to be formed in any of democratic regimes.</li>
<li>Comparing to the companies in the same currency zone, the international flow of the money is decided by too many factors. If the money not flowing in those countries then the value wouldn’t recover. There has to be some reason to flow in, and merely undervalue may not be a strong enough reason.</li>
</ol>
<p>I tried to make another list by the <a href="http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datacurrent.html">data</a> compiled by Damodaran. I removed the countries that has too few stocks listed, and sorted the list by from high to low by ROIC, then ROE. and low to high by EV/EBIT. The reason to make this sorting is that I think marginal investment return would be a stronger reason to attract the money to flow in, but not simply low value. The list is like the following:</p>

<p>For the top 20 there are some overlaps, but the rankings that was in the low Shiller 10 year CAPE are ranked lower. This ranking somehow matches with some of my private findings of good value company globally. I would argue this ranking should be a relative good pool to fish. But not the simply low multiple ranking. With that said, I didn’t do thorough research to do back-testing etc. It’s simply my hunch though.</p>
<p>This is just a rundown of my thoughts, not a rigorous research.</p>
