      <article>
        <p>Haskell is notorious for plethoric libraries on Hackage. For a beginner, it’s easy to lose in the forest of Hackage. With the establishment of Haskell Platform and the advice from experts ( link1, link2 ). the situation is getting better. But for a community, more tutorials would be more plausible. Therefore I decide to write down my library survey.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-this-library-for">What is this library for?</h3>
<p>If you remembered it well in Learn you a Haskell for Great Good, it mentions that the List append operation (++) takes linear time. It’s implementation in Haskell 98 Report looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>infixr 5  ++
(++) :: [a] -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
[]     ++ ys = ys
(x:xs) ++ ys = x : (xs ++ ys)</code></pre>
<p>It’s obvious you have to traverse through all of the elements in the first list to get the operation done, hence linear time. And fortunately, ++ is right associative, which means when you are writing snippets like this, assuming as, bs, cs are all lists.</p>
<p>It essentially means</p>
<pre><code>(as ++ (bs ++ cs))</code></pre>
<p>Based on the previous reasoning, it won’t cost us too much, merely the length of as plus the length of bs.</p>
<p>But there IS some common cases that gets us in trouble. Let’s take a look at this example from here:</p>
<p>appendToContent str page = page {pageContent = newContent} where newContent = (pageContent page) ++ str It is a naiive implementation usually occurs in Logger or the streaming output of a HTTP server. The problem of this pattern is it forces the concatenation to be left associative. Using the previous as ++ bs ++ cs as our example, it will become:</p>
<pre><code>((as ++ bs) ++ cs)</code></pre>
<p>It is unacceptable because the left associative ++ costs us quadratic time in the size of resulting list. To see that, here is an excerpt from ezyang’s post</p>
<p>For clarity, we rewrite the definition from Haskell 98 to a ++ b = foldr (:) b a, the time complexity is the same.</p>
<pre><code>(as ++ bs) ++ cs
= foldr (:) cs (as ++ bs)
= foldr (:) cs (foldr (:) bs as)
= foldr (:) cs (foldr (:) bs (a:as'))
= foldr (:) cs (a : foldr (:) b as')
= a : foldr (:) cs (foldr (:) bs as')</code></pre>
<p>“This is normal, each string append operation costs you linear time in most programming languages after all.” you said. “Joel Spolsky even make this problem famously known as Schlemiel the Painter’s algorithm.”</p>
<p>But sometimes we DO care about performance. Logger and streaming output of a HTTP server previously mentioned are two of them. We really need efficient list append operation</p>
<p>There are a few reasonable tactics according to Norman Ramsey</p>
<p>Standard list with cons. Difference list (John Hughes list) with constant-time append. Algebraic data type supporting constant-time append: data Alist a = ANil | ASingle a | AAppend (Alist a) (Alist a). List of lists with final concat. It depends on the problem you are working to choose the most appropriate one. Here we focus on the second one, Difference List, because it is the one used in the blaze-builder. It’s originally designed for the streaming output of html. Therefore the append is truly the issue we care about.</p>
<h3 id="difference-list">Difference List</h3>
<p>The difference list is a data strucutre empowers us constant-time append. As the definition given by Haskell Wiki:</p>
<p>It is a function f, which when given a list x, returns the list that f represents, prepended to x. Hard to imagine? Let’s take a look at a concrete example defined in Haskell: the ShowS type: The difference list specifically for List of Char.</p>
<p>Its type in Haskell 98 Report is:</p>
<pre><code>type ShowS = String -&gt; String</code></pre>
<p>Judging from its type, it basically matches the description of a difference list. It is a function accepting a String, and supposedly output a String prepending something to x.</p>
<p>Here is a toy example, using snoc (the inverse of cons) to append Char one by one to the end of difference list.</p>
<pre><code>toString :: ShowS -&gt; String
toString = ($ [])
snoc ∷ ShowS → Char → ShowS
snoc f a = f ∘ (a:)
emptyH ∷ ShowS
emptyH = id
body ∷ String → ShowS → ShowS
body (x:xs) acc = body xs (acc `snoc` x)
body _ acc = acc
run ∷ String → String
run xs = toString (body xs emptyH)
main = putStrLn $ run &quot;1234&quot;</code></pre>
<p>We heavily rely on the function composition of (a:). With composition we can achieve the constant-time append, and stil preserve some properties of a list. To convert a difference list to a normal list of Char, apply the function to an empty list []. It is what toString is doing.</p>
<p>The introduction of a function enables us to evaluate left-associated construction in right-associated fashion.</p>
<pre><code>(as . (bs . cs)) 
= as . bs .cs
= (as . (bs . cs))</code></pre>
<p>With ShowS, we can rewrite the previous example with showString, which is defined as showString s = (s++)`` haskell appendToContent str page = page {pageContent = newContent} where newContent = (pageContent page) . showString str ```</p>
<p>Another excerpt from ezyang’s post proves the work of a difference list. (called Hughes List here)</p>
<pre><code>type Hughes a = [a] -&gt; [a]
listrep :: Hughes a -&gt; [a]
listrep = (\l -&gt; l [])
append :: Hughes a -&gt; Hughes a -&gt; Hughes a
append a b = (\z -&gt; a (b z))
listrep (append (append a b) c)
= (\l -&gt; l []) (append (append a b) c)
= (append (append a b) c) []
= (\z -&gt; (append a b) (c z)) []
= (append a b) (c [])
= (\z -&gt; a (b z)) (c [])
= a (b (c []))</code></pre>
<h3 id="blaze-builder">Blaze-Builder</h3>
<p>Difference list is not limited to list of Char. Elaborating on ShowS is merely for explanation. It can be generalized to list of Chunks, or ByteString for performant output.</p>
<p>Data.Binary.Builder was frontier to use this pattern. The internal working of provided Builder type is essentially a difference list. The purpose of binary package is to encode the Haskell value into binary format and serialize them to external devices, network devices. And blaze-builder, as in Simon’s and Jaspervdj’s introduction (The latter one is a little bit outdated), it is a drop-in replacement for Data.Binary.Builder, with speed and expressiveness enhancement.</p>
<p>A toy example from the documentation:</p>
<pre><code>import Data.Monoid
import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy as L
import Blaze.ByteString.Builder
import Blaze.ByteString.Builder.Char.Utf8
strings :: [String]
strings = replicate 10000 &quot;Hello World!&quot;
concatenation :: Builder
concatenation = mconcat $ map fromString strings
result :: L.ByteString
result = toLazyByteString concatenation
main = L.putStrLn result</code></pre>
<p>This example serializes 10000 instances of “Hello World” to binary representation, which coincidently to be ASCII encoding of bytes. We use provided fromString to serialize a single String to Builder. And the Builder provides a Monoid interface, which means we have mconcat to efficiently concat them, as we do for the difference list.</p>
<p>After that, we use toLazyByteString to transform it from Builder to ByteString, just like we call toString in the ShowS example.</p>
<p>With ByteString we have putStrLn function to output the binary representation to external devices.</p>
<h3 id="postscript">Postscript</h3>
<p>According to this slide by Simon Meiser. It seems that he is working on bytestring package to incorporate similiar techniques used on blaze-builder. Perhaps after a while the blaze-builder could be replaced by binary. But at this time, a lot of packages are still using blaze-builder. It is still worth it to have a basic understanding of what this library is doing.</p>

      <article>
        <p>This article serves as my digestion of Template Haskell, an GHC extension enables us to use Haskell Language itself to metaprogram. It is extensively used in Yesod Web Framework, so understanding it thoroughly undoubtedly facilitate us run Yesod in its full power. Before we do that, let’s go through common approaches used to metaprogram.</p>
<p>As most of terminology used in the community of programming language, metaprogramming is vaguely defined in my opinion. From the third sence of etymology dictionary, an literal interpretation would be “program of that which trancends the program.” That brings us to the definition from wikipedia:</p>
<p>Metaprogramming is the writing of computer programs that write or manipulate other programs (or themselves) as their data, or that do part of the work at compile time that would otherwise be done at runtime. For me the important part is to be able to manipulate programs, or code as data. You either do it at runtime, which is usually what most dynamic typing programming language would do, or rely on compilers help you to do so (at compile time).</p>
<p>One of common approaches toward the former one is sacrificing encapsulation to leak the internal of the runtime engine. Popular dynamic typing programming languages like Ruby, Python, PHP, Javascript all choose to do so, but this feature not just involves these languages. Java, instead of stressing on encapsulation, chooses to leak the class information of JVM and achieve the same effect. But this trade-off is benefitial considered that it makes the languages can metaprogram in their own languages, without any extra extension.</p>
<p>Speaking of the latter, we would mention probably the first language what most programmers know, C++ template. Programmers describe a template and instantiate a set of them, then compiler will generate the source code corresponding to the instantiation. C++ template is an outcome of accident. It is discovered to be Turing-complete during the process of standardization, which means you can crash the compiler by writing code never stop. Here is a C++ template metaprogram to generate Fibonacci sequence at compile time.</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

template &lt;int N&gt;
struct Fibonacci
{
    enum { value = Fibonacci&lt;N-2&gt;::value + Fibonacci&lt;N-1&gt;::value };
};

template &lt;&gt;
struct Fibonacci&lt;2&gt;
{
    enum { value = 1 };
};

template &lt;&gt;
struct Fibonacci&lt;1&gt;
{
    enum { value = 1 };
};

int main()
{
    int x = Fibonacci&lt;4&gt;::value;
    int y = Fibonacci&lt;20&gt;::value;

    std::cout &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; &quot; &quot; &lt;&lt; y &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    return 0;
}</code></pre>
<p>Lisp family worths another paragraph apart from the previous approaches. They are so special because of homoiconicity: a programming language where the primary representation of programs is also a data-structure in a primitive type of the language itself. In Lisp family, the code itself can be seen as a representation of its abstract syntax tree, with parenthesis as the subtree boundaries. Hence we have such a powerful Macro system in lisp, which directly operates on the abstract syntax tree. Or it can be seen as functions transforming from one syntax tree to another. In clojure, a dialect of lisp run on JVM, we can observe the behavior of macro like this.</p>
<p>First bring up the REPL</p>
<pre><code>$ clojure-repl
WARNING: clojure.lang.Repl is deprecated.
Instead, use clojure.main like this:
java -cp clojure.jar clojure.main -i init.clj -r args...
Clojure 1.1.0
user=&gt;
then type

ser=&gt; (defmacro Square [X] `(* ~X ~X))
#'user/Square
user=&gt; (macroexpand-1 '(Square 9))
(clojure.core/* 9 9)</code></pre>
<p>Template Haskell, though not homoiconic, imitates Lispy macro behavior. If you are familiar with Common Lisp, Scheme or Clojure, understanding Template Haskell should be fairly easy. It could be vaguely thought as a type-safe, compile time version of lispy macro system.</p>
<h3 id="template-haskell">Template Haskell</h3>
<p>Template Haskell currently is not a part of standard, neither Haskell 98 nor Haskell 2010. It is just an experimental extension of GHC. In order to use it, you have to add a few lines at the head of file. (The environment here is GHC 7.0.4)</p>
<pre><code>{-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell #-} import Language.Haskell.TH</code></pre>
<p>Otherwise in ghci, you have to use operator :set and :module.</p>
<pre><code>ghci&gt; :set -XTemplateHaskell 
ghci&gt; :module + Language.Haskell.TH</code></pre>
<p>In parallel to Lispy quote, Haskell provides what is called “Quote Monad” type or just “Q Monad”. They works just like Lispy “quote” with four different types for different syntax program structures: expression, declaration, type and pattern To use them, enclose a piece of code in Oxford Brackets [| … |], instead of lispy `(+ ~X ~X).</p>
<pre><code>[e| ...(some Haskell code)... |] :: Q Exp   -- Expression 
[d| ...(some Haskell code)... |] :: Q [Dec] -- Declaration
[t| ...(some Haskell code)... |] :: Q Type  -- Type
[p| ...(some Haskell code)... |] :: Q Pat   -- Pattern</code></pre>
<p>For those don’t understand Lisp, just think of them as functions mapping a string containing haskell code to its corresponding abstract syntax tree.</p>
<p>In Lisp, to evaluate a macro, just surround it with parenthesis and feed it with correct arguments: (Square 9) In Template Haskell, we use $() to achieve the same effect, and the terminology used is “Splices”.</p>
<pre><code>$([d| ... (some haskell code) ... |])</code></pre>
<p>And again, you can simply think of it as a function mapping an abstract syntax tree to the corresponding haskell code string.</p>
<p>Let’s start with a very simple example, not hello world, but one plus one. In haskell, it would like this:</p>
<p>With Tempalte Haskell, we can rewrite it like this:</p>
<pre><code>{-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell #-} 
import Language.Haskell.TH 
f = $([e| 1+1 |]) 
main = print f</code></pre>
<p>We replace the 1+1 expression with corresponding Oxford Brackets for expression [e| … |], and generate code (or evalute it) with $(…).</p>
<p>You may also try to include f to our expression.</p>
<pre><code>{-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell #-} 
import Language.Haskell.TH 
-- error 
$([e| f = 1+1 |]) 
main = print f</code></pre>
<p>Sadly it is illegal, because it is a declaration but not an expression. We have to use Oxford Brackets for declaration [d| … |].</p>
<pre><code>{-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell #-} 
import Language.Haskell.TH 
$([d| f = 1+1 |]) 
main = print f</code></pre>
<p>Now you get a little hang of it, we can even include the main declaration.</p>
<pre><code>{-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell #-} 
import Language.Haskell.TH 
$([d| f = 1+1 |]) 
$([d| main = print f |])</code></pre>
<p>Actually, we don’t see a lot of work under water behind this cover of ease of usage. We are in a static typing functional language, so there must be some magical types easy to compose behind the scene. And here we are, let’s type a few characters in ghci.</p>
<pre><code>ghci&gt; runQ [e| 1+1 |] InfixE (Just (LitE (IntegerL 1))) (VarE GHC.Num.+) (Just (LitE (IntegerL 1)))
</code></pre>
<p>With runQ, we can acquire the type info behind the scene, they are Q Monads. Watching it closely and you will notice that they corresponds the strcture of abstract syntax tree. (LitE (IntegerL 1)) gives us literal value 1. and InfixE … (VarE GHC.Num.+) … gives us plus operator.</p>
<p>Let’s put it in declaration.</p>
<pre><code>ghci&gt; runQ [d| f=1+1 |] 
[ValD (VarP f) (NormalB (InfixE (Just (LitE (IntegerL 1))) (VarE GHC.Num.+) (Just (LitE (IntegerL 1))))) []]</code></pre>
<p>Now the extra elements are ValD (VarP f) (NormalB …). It is obvious that it is a top-level binding.</p>
<p>You can try it with your own example like hello world:</p>
<pre><code>ghci&gt; runQ [d| main=putStrLn &quot;Hello World!&quot; |] 
[ValD (VarP main) (NormalB (AppE (VarE System.IO.putStrLn) (LitE (StringL &quot;Hello World!&quot;)))) []]</code></pre>
<p>Not every expression or declaration can be such simple, put them in brackets and voila. Sometimes you have to compose them by yourselves, or compiler would complain. Continuing with out hello world example, we can write it like this.</p>
<pre><code>main = $(appE (varE $ mkName &quot;putStrLn&quot;) (litE (stringL &quot;Hello World!&quot;)))</code></pre>
<p>Here we compose abstract syntax tree with Q monad, then splice it with $( … ) operator. Or you can use do to glue Q Monad together.</p>
<pre><code>{-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell, QuasiQuotes #-} 
import Language.Haskell.TH 
do 
  mainQ &lt;- valD (varP $ mkName &quot;main&quot;) (normalB (appE (varE 'putStrLn) (litE (stringL &quot;Hello World!&quot;)))) [] return [mainQ]</code></pre>
<h3 id="quasi-quote">Quasi Quote</h3>
<p>Another extension commonly used with Template Haskell is Quasi Quote. It extends the Oxford Brackets beyond the basic four to your likeness, like [foo| … |]</p>
<p>To use that you not only have to switch on the flags,</p>
<pre><code>{-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell, QuasiQuotes #-}
ghci&gt; :set -XQuasiQuotes
but also define QuasiQuoter

foo = QuasiQuoter { quoteExp = parseExp :: String -&gt; Q Exp , quotePat = undefined :: String -&gt; Q Pat , quoteType = undefined :: String -&gt; Q Type , quoteDec = undefined :: String -&gt; Q [Dec] }</code></pre>
<p>You can see that the four fields correspond to the original four: expression, pattern, type and declaration. It tells quasiquoter to use quoteExp when located at expression context, quotePat when located at pattern context, and so on.</p>
<p>Here is an example from the HaskellWiki. Due to the restriction of Template Haskell, the definition has to go to different source files.</p>
<pre><code>Main.hs {-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell, QuasiQuotes #-} module Main where

import Data.Generics import qualified Language.Haskell.TH as TH import Language.Haskell.TH.Quote import Expr

main :: IO () main = do print $ eval [expr| 1 + 3 + 5 |] case IntExpr 1 of [expr|$int:n|] -&gt; print n _ -&gt; return () ```

<p>Template Haskell can also arouse some problems when working with generic programming. So be careful about using it.</p>
