                      <p>Looking over the investment decisions I made in the past half year, I become aware that I’ve made a few bad decisions. Overall the result is still profitable because those failures are small positions, but I knew that I have to be honest to myself so that I could learn from that. Those successful decisions are mainly the idea I learned from SeekingAlpha, Xueqiu, or ideas from subscriptions. However, the investment idea that I build from scratch are mostly not successful. I am still far from the skill level I would like to reach. I know I need to put down a checklist into my system so that I could stop myself from tripping on the same mistakes again. Noting them down would also help me to review my thinking at the time.</p>

Location of the real-estate, high-switching cost? patents? contracts? network-effects? shelve-space? brand? economy of scale? regulatory? high barrier of entry? technical skill? reputation? intangible like database, credit records, or sports right?</li>
<li>Is it a growth company with good runway, what’s the CAGR? Is it grow by acquisition? If organic growth, break down the source of growth. Is it grow by market share? International expansion?

<li>Is it cyclical? What makes you confident that you are on the right trend?</li>
