      <article>
        <p>You hardly can miss Arrow on your path of learning Haskell. Just after struggling with Functor, Applicative and Monad, you convince yourself that you can finally take a look at those standard libraries requiring you the knowledge of Monad. A few Arrow interface libraries such as Hakyll, HXT, reactive-banana just punch you in the face. You just don’t understand what that is. Finishing tutorials on wikibook (link1, link2) do help, but you still can’t get the whole picture. What’s the relationship between Arrow and Monad? Is there non-trivial concrete example that can persuade me it is useful? Here I try to provide my answers.</p>
<h3 id="why-monad-is-not-enough">Why Monad is not Enough</h3>
<p>Arrow is proposed by John Hughes in 1998. As described in his paper Generalising Monads to Arrows, the purpose of Arrows is to resolve the issue of memory consumption in using moandic parser. An example from the paper is:</p>
<pre><code>instance MonadPlus Parser where
    P a + P b = P (\s -&gt; case a s of 
                            Just (x, s') -&gt; Just (x, s')
                            Nothing -&gt; b s)</code></pre>
<p>The property of Plus corresponds to backtracking parsers. The input s is retained in the memory and not garbage collected as long as the parser a succeeding in parsing. If a succeeds a large part of the input s before it eventually fails, then a great deal of space would be used to hold these already-parsed tokens. To resolve this kind of problems, the Arrows was proposed.</p>
<p>Besides the issue mentioned above, We know that Monads essentially provide a sequential interface to computation. One can build a computation out of a value, or sequence two computations. The structure of Monads empowers us convenience and at the same time limits its usage. Some problem domains can not be modeled with Monads, jaspervdj proposes that a building system like Hakyll is one of them.</p>
<p>In general, the structure that is not sequental, but is much like electronic circuits can be modeled by Arrows. Monads fails to model these structures. Its composability is not as flexible as Arrows.</p>
<h3 id="typeclassopedia">Typeclassopedia</h3>
<p>Let’s see a diagram from Typeclassopedia by Brent Yorgey.</p>
<p><img src="../images/legacy/0*EAp1EQzHN6cvH0px.png" /></p>
<p>This diagram tells us the relationship between Monads and Arrows. Unlike Functor and Applicative, they are basically different things and from different lineage.</p>
<p>First of all, an Arrow has to be an Category. Category generalizes the notion of function composition to the morphisms in Category Theory. Its definition in base package is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>class Category cat where
    id :: cat a a
    (.) :: cat b c -&gt; cat a b -&gt; cat a c</code></pre>
<p>We can see that it requires an identity morphism id, and the composition operator (.) for morphisms. Also note that Category is unequivalent to arbitrary categories in Category Theory. It only corresponds to those categories whose objects are objects of Hask.</p>
<p>Laying on the foundation of Category, Arrow’s definition is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>class Category a =&gt; Arrow a where
    arr :: (b -&gt; c) -&gt; a b c
    first :: a b c -&gt; a (b, d) (c, d)
    second :: a b c -&gt; a (d, b) (d, c)
    (***) :: a b c -&gt; a b' c' -&gt; a (b, b') (c, c')
    (&amp;&amp;&amp;) :: a b c -&gt; a b c' -&gt; a b (c, c')</code></pre>
<p>There are five methods here, but actually you only have to define arr and first. Rest of them can be automatically derived.</p>
<p>To see how these five composing methods work, let’s try out an easy example. That is to model an OR gate with NAND gates.</p>
<p><img src="../images/legacy/0*6ek_K8IaTNu-E0J0.png" /></p>
<p>We can duplicate the input to the first level NAND gates with id and &amp;&amp;&amp;, and to combine the results of first level NAND gates, we can use *** operator. In chart it looks like this.</p>
<p><img src="../images/legacy/0*1DCS_3OU5QVKmo-O.png" /></p>
<p>To implements it in haskell we also need to define the circuit element as instances of Category and Arrow, we call it Auto.</p>
<pre><code>{-# LANGUAGE Arrows #-}
import Prelude hiding (id, (.))
import Control.Arrow
import Control.Category

data Auto b c = Auto (b -&gt; c)

instance Category Auto where
    id = Auto id
    Auto f . Auto g = Auto (f . g)

instance Arrow Auto where
    arr f = Auto f 
    first (Auto f) = Auto $ \(x, y) -&gt; (f x, y)

nand2 :: Auto (Bool, Bool) Bool
nand2 = arr (not . uncurry (&amp;&amp;))

or2 :: Auto (Bool, Bool) Bool
or2 = ((arr (id) &amp;&amp;&amp; arr (id)) &gt;&gt;&gt; nand2) *** ((arr (id) &amp;&amp;&amp; arr (id)) &gt;&gt;&gt; nand2) &gt;&gt;&gt; nand2

runAutoA :: (Bool, Bool) -&gt; Auto (Bool, Bool) a -&gt; IO a
runAutoA x (Auto f) = return (f x)

main = do 
    let comb = [(False, False), (False, True), (True, False), (True, True)]
    result &lt;- sequence $ flip runAutoA or2 `map` comb 
    putStrLn $ show result</code></pre>
<h3 id="arrow-notation">Arrow Notation</h3>
<p>When we are tackling larger problems, the notation soon gets complicated to handle. That’s why we want to have do block syntax sugar to make it look nicer, as we do for Monad. GHC provides Arrow Notation, but it’s currently not part of Haskell 98, you must enable the corresponding extension: with -XArrow or prepend a header line to the files {-# LANGUAGE Arrows #-}. After that, we can rewrite our OR gate example above with Arrow notation.</p>
<pre><code>{-# LANGUAGE Arrows #-}
import Prelude hiding (id, (.))
import Control.Arrow
import Control.Category

data Auto b c = Auto (b -&gt; c)

instance Category Auto where
    id = Auto id
    Auto f . Auto g = Auto (f . g)

instance Arrow Auto where
    arr f = Auto f 
    first (Auto f) = Auto $ \(x, y) -&gt; (f x, y)

nand2 :: Auto (Bool, Bool) Bool
nand2 = arr (not . uncurry (&amp;&amp;))

or2' :: Auto (Bool, Bool) Bool
or2' = proc (i0, i1) -&gt; do 
        m1 &lt;- nand2 -&lt; (i0,i0)
        m2 &lt;- nand2 -&lt; (i1,i1)
        nand2 -&lt; (m1,m2)  

runAutoA :: (Bool, Bool) -&gt; Auto (Bool, Bool) a -&gt; IO a
runAutoA x (Auto f) = return (f x)

main = do 
    let comb = [(False, False), (False, True), (True, False), (True, True)]
    result' &lt;- sequence $ flip runAutoA or2' `map` comb 
    putStrLn $ show result'</code></pre>
<p>The pattern is keyword proc followed with the input symbols, then -&gt; do. We describe each elemment in each line. m1 &lt;- nand2 -&lt; (i0,i0) means nand2 accept a tuple (i0, i0) and the its output is bound to the name m1. The last line must be an expression, just like Monad, its value denotes the value of the whole do block. In this case, its the output of nand2 -&lt; (m1,m2)</p>
<h3 id="a-more-complicated-example">A More Complicated Example</h3>
<p>Already know how to simulate OR with NAND, let’s implement a hald-adder.</p>
<p><img src="../images/legacy/0*MIcgossP8D0G67Vu.png" /></p>
<p>With the help of Arrow Notation, all we need to do is to define the instances, and drawing circuits with &lt;- and -&lt; symbols in the program.</p>
<pre><code>{-# LANGUAGE Arrows #-}
import Prelude hiding (id, (.))
import Control.Arrow
import Control.Category

data Auto b c = Auto (b -&gt; c)

instance Category Auto where
    id = Auto id
    Auto f . Auto g = Auto (f . g)

instance Arrow Auto where
    arr f = Auto f 
    first (Auto f) = Auto $ \(x, y) -&gt; (f x, y)

and2 :: Auto (Bool, Bool) Bool
and2 = arr (uncurry (&amp;&amp;))

or2 :: Auto (Bool, Bool) Bool
or2 = arr (uncurry (||))

nand2 :: Auto (Bool, Bool) Bool
nand2 = arr (not . uncurry (&amp;&amp;))

xor2 :: Auto (Bool, Bool) Bool
xor2 = proc i -&gt; do
        m0 &lt;- nand2 -&lt; i
        m1 &lt;- or2 -&lt; i
        and2 -&lt; (m0, m1)

hAdder :: Auto (Bool, Bool) (Bool, Bool)
hAdder = proc i -&gt; do
          o0 &lt;- xor2 -&lt; i
          o1 &lt;- and2 -&lt; i
          id -&lt; (o1, o0)

runAutoA :: (Bool, Bool) -&gt; Auto (Bool, Bool) a -&gt; IO a
runAutoA x (Auto f) = return (f x)

main = do 
    putStr &quot;Hello &quot;
    pairs &lt;- runAutoA (True, True) hAdder 
    putStrLn $ show pairs</code></pre>
<h3 id="postscript">Postscript</h3>
<p>As you can see from typeclassopedia diagram, there are variants of Arrow. They are ArrowZero, ArrowPlus, ArrowLoop, ArrowChoice and ArrowApply, where ArrowApply is equivalent to Monad. I’ll write another post to introduce them another days.</p>

        <p>For a beginner of haskell coming from popular imperative languages with “Generic” or “Template” construct in them, like C++, Java, it is not too hard to accept the parametric polymorphism at first glance. The type signature of id :: a -&gt; a can quickly remind him of C++ template.</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

using namespace std;

template &lt;typename T&gt;
T id(const T &amp;x)
{
        return x; 
}

int main()
{
        cout &lt;&lt; id(1) &lt;&lt; endl;
        cout &lt;&lt; id(string(&quot;foo&quot;)) &lt;&lt; endl;
        return 0;
}</code></pre>
<p>However, the thing would become complicated when he bumped to the type signature of runST</p>
<pre><code>runST :: (forall s. ST s a) -&gt; a</code></pre>
<p>A few questions pop out. What the hell is that forall, and what are Rank2Types and RankNTypes documented in the GHC manual?</p>
<h3 id="higher-rank-polymorphism">Higher Rank Polymorphism</h3>
<p>The parametric polymorphism you usually see is actually Rank-1 Polymorphism. There is actually Rank-2 polymorphism … to Rank-N polymorphism. In not quite exact language, a Rank-1 polymorphic function is that it doesn’t depend on its input/output types. The type become parameters, and when you call the function, the types are “instantiated.” And Rank-2 polymorphic function is a function gets called with its parameters parameterized, or to be Rank-1 polymorphic. So on, Rank-N polymorphic function is a function gets called with its parameters to be Rank-(N-1) polymorphic.</p>
<p>Let’s look at a Rank-2 example. Suppose we have a list of Int and a list of Char, we want to write a function to check if the results of applying a function to both lists are equal. Use case would look like this.</p>
<pre><code>check f l1 l2 = (f l1) == (f l2)

main = do
    print $ check length [1,2,3,4] ['a','b','c','d']
    print $ check ((+2) . length) [1,2] ['a']</code></pre>
<p>We can see that we want parameter f of check to be a Rank-1 polymorphic function, so that we can apply it to both [Int] and [Char]. In such case, what would be the type signature of check? Let’s look at how we can declare it in haskell.</p>
<h3 id="forall">forall</h3>
<p>Parametric polymorphism is implicit in haskell. When you write a -&gt; a, actually it is forall a. a -&gt; a. forall is the keyword to explicitly declare what is your type parameter, or type variable. A few examples from standard lib can be explicitly written like this.</p>
<pre><code>length :: forall a. [a] -&gt; Int
fst :: forall a b. (a,b) -&gt; a
map :: forall a b. (a -&gt; b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b]</code></pre>
<p>Writing out explicitly, we declare the type signature of check as check :: (forall a. [a] -&gt; Int) -&gt; forall b. [b] -&gt; forall c. [c] -&gt; Bool. Notice that the effective range of forall greedily extends to the most right end, so the type signature above is equivalent to check :: (forall a. a -&gt; [Int]) -&gt; (forall b. [b] -&gt; (forall c. [c] -&gt; Bool)). But so many forall in the type signature, you would ask where should I put the forall to express a Rank-2 polymorphic function. Just as this link said, you can consider forall as a type level lambda /. This lambda / has some operational similarity with , instead of declare a variable binding, it binds type variables. A parallel in C++ would be binding T of template <typename T> to the corresponding template.</p>
<p>With this in mind, basically we can write out the type variables and normal variables at the same time in / and . It would look like check = &gt; /&gt; 1 -&gt; /&gt; 2 -&gt; Bool, where f is a function which is /-&gt; -&gt; Int.</p>
<p>Here is a working example:</p>
<pre><code>{-# LANGUAGE RankNTypes #-}
module Main(main) where

import Prelude hiding (length)

length :: forall a. [a] -&gt; Int 
length (x:xs) = 1 + (length xs)
length [] = 0

check :: (forall a. [a] -&gt; Int) -&gt; forall b. [b] -&gt; forall c. [c] -&gt; Bool
check f l1 l2 = (f l1) == (f l2)

main = do
    print $ check length [1] ['a','b']</code></pre>
<p>You can play with Rank-N Type with N greater than 2. The spirit is the same. This is an example from here.</p>
<pre><code>{-# LANGUAGE RankNTypes #-}
module Main (main) where

g1 :: a -&gt; a 
g1 x = x

g2 :: (forall a. a -&gt; a) -&gt; (Bool, Char)
g2 f = (f True, f 'a')

g3 :: ((forall a. a -&gt; a) -&gt; (Bool, Char)) -&gt; (Char, Bool)
g3 f = (\x -&gt; (snd x, fst x)) (f g1)

g4 :: (((forall a. a-&gt; a) -&gt; (Bool, Char)) -&gt; (Char, Bool)) -&gt; (Bool, Char)
g4 f = (\x -&gt; (snd x, fst x)) (f g2)

main = do
    putStrLn &quot;Rank-2:&quot;
    putStrLn . show . fst $ (g2 g1)
    putStrLn . show . snd $ (g2 g1)
    putStrLn &quot;Rank-3:&quot;
    putStrLn . show . fst . g3 $ g2
    putStrLn . show . snd . g3 $ g2
    putStrLn &quot;Rank-4:&quot;
    putStrLn . show . fst . g4 $ g3
    putStrLn . show . snd . g4 $ g3Possible Confusion</code></pre>
<h3 id="possible-confusion">Possible Confusion</h3>
<p>Due to the usage of forall keyword, it is very easy to confuse RankNTypes, Existential Types and Scoped Type Variables. You can go to check out an excellent discussion on stackoverflow. Also don’t miss out John Lato’s and ezyang’s explanations on Existenatial Types.</p>
